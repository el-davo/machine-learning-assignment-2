This project uses the wine quality dataset which can be found at the following link

## How to run the notebook

Make sure you have jupyter notebook installed. Depending on the version of jupyter notebook you have installed you need to run either of these commands to start the notebook

```
jupyter notebook
```

or

```
jupyter-notebook
```

When the notebook opens in a browser, you can open the file called `main.ipynb`.

Alternatively to see the rendered notebook you can visit the following url on github (which is my personal repo) - https://github.com/el-davo/machine-learning-assignment-2/blob/master/main.ipynb
